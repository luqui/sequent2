sequent2
========

A new system (IDE/language) for organizing code.

Since I am dogfooding as much as possible, Sequent is being developed entirely on Amazon S3, so this repository
is basically just for snapshots at key points in the project, for historical and safety purposes.

See downloads for the stuff (for the time being).
